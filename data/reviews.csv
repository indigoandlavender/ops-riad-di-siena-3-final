The room decor was perfect for the type of trip we wanted - clean but with the cultural feel of being in Morocco. The alley way to get to the property can feel a bit dodgy, but in all honesty, most of the streets off from the main square felt this way, and we never had any issues. The breakfast was absolutely incredible, with both a hot omelette served with juices, traditional Moroccan tea and some cold fruit and baked goods. The lady who made it was also very nice.  I would say to stay here during the warmer months would be incredible, extremely well located, great attention from staff to helping you and beautiful rooms.","Be careful booking a traditional Riad in Morocco during the colder months of Nov-Feb - we did find the room to get quite cold.

The breakfast was tasty.","The property manager encouraged us to order our dinners from the property at 100 MAD per person for sandwiches.  She kept emphacizing that the food sold in the medina could make us sick.  We'd been to other medinas in Morocco and didn't have problems with the food, so we took a chance.  We tried all types of eateries in the medina and didn't have any issues, so it made us think that she was trying to sell us overpriced food from her.

I trust in the Universe that there are good people who have discernement and not judge us on your exceptional and unfair poor reviews. Its unfortunate that you had a bad experience and I am sorry for this. I emailed you asking for your dietary requirements.  If you told me that you are lactose intolerant, we would have prepared a different breakfast. You clearly did not read the 2 emails I sent you. Communication is a two-way street. Now, I will clarify the truth about your accusations against Khadija. Your husband who speaks perfect French asked Khadija to arrange transportation to Agafay without mentioning that you were going to the Agafay Luxury Camp. Instead you waited until you arrived in Agafay to tell the driver what is the exact location you wanted to go. This camp is located at the end of the Agafay not at the beginning. Thats why the price quote is not the same. If you told them that you were going to that camp from the start, they would have given you the correct price. And it was up to you to decide. Also, from what the drivers told me, your husband was agressive and abusive to them. Khadija has never been abusive to anyone. This has been confirmed by the driver who was with you. Also just read her guest reviews. You were all screaming in the ca and I think that things got heated too much.  You can make me accountable for recommending you the driver but I am telling things as they are and there was clearly no malicious intent to scam you as you claim. If you got scammed throughout your whole trip by other people, it is unfair that you assume the worse from us. You cannot make defamatory allegations like this against someone who tried to help you out. Unlike other riads, we do not sell excursions to our guests. We only respond to guests requests if they need a driver. We do not take any commission. The price is quoted by the driver and offered to guests at cost price. So what is the benefit for Khadija to scam you in this event? Why would we jeopardize our reputation for 20 Euros? We are not bad people getting in life to scam people.  Khadija and the riad have 5.0 star reviews on booking and other platforms.  If this was the case, people would have flagged us a long time ago. I am sorry that you had to feel that you were scammed by everybody. If you want to see the bad in someone this is what you will see. And if you decide to see us as bad people, well it's your perogative but you do not have the right to accuse someone of wrong doing by assuming the worse and especially without proof. Next time, make sure that your communications are crystal clear before you go anywhere. That applies to Morocco and to any place in the world. I wish you well."

Thank you for your kind review. We greatly appreciate it. That said, I will address your comment about the price of the dinners. We ask for 250 dh / person for a 3-course meal (salads, tagines, desserts). This is the price that all good quality riads charge in Marrakech and Fes. Please do a web search and you will see that this price is normal. Maybe some lower quality riads ask for less but we certainly do not claim to be the cheapest riad in Marrakech. We source our food from local farms. We make our breads and jams in-house. Most of our food are home made not store bought. Quality and value are important to us. We have no interest in price gouging our guests. And so, at the end of the day, I am happy that you found our breakfast delicious."

The location is perfect. It's less than 5 minutes away from Jemaa El-Fna and Koutoubia mosque.

After I safely got back to Australia I started the process of trying to get a refund for the nights I didn't stay there which they refused outright, they didn't even try to start a conversation with me regarding the issue.

There is no travel advisory urging people to leave Marrakesh. In that case, cancellation policies stand and there are no refunds. Please check with your travel insurance.

The shower had air when I hopped in and there was no toilet brush.
More than anything, I agreed for a meeting point on the Riad's suggestion. Ten minutes before the time agreed, I I reminded them I would meet them there and they said they were on their way. 15 minutes later, they texted the address of the Riad and that they were waiting there. I decided to just go and it took me another 30 minutes to find the correct building.","6","7.5","5.0","2.5","5.0","7.5","5.0","Hi Flavia, Thank you for your comments. These will surely help us make our guest care even better. To plan our breakfast meals, we asked for your dietary preferences: gluten-free, vegan, etc. That said, our breakfast changes every day and is served in rotation based on the order of the guest's arrival. The other guests were given a different breakfast because they did not arrive on the same day as you; they were served the same breakfast you had on their first day. As mentioned in my communications, if a guest needs anything, he or she just has to ask. We quickly respond to all requests. If you asked us for a toilet brush, we would have provided you with one. As for the directions, I myself (the owner) actually went to meet you at the meeting point, but you were not there. Then we called you, and you did not answer your phone. We are on Google Maps, the address is clearly visible on Booking and was provided again in the email we sent to all guests. If a guest still cannot come on their own, we are there to provide directions. Communication is a two-way street. We did everything possible to help you.  If you got lost, its a bit much to expect that we should go and find you on the streets. You gave us a rating of 2.5 for our location and 5 for the value. We are centrally located, steps away from the souks and the Place Jemaa el Fnaa. This makes me wonder what rating you would have given to a riad that is located a 20-minute walk from the main square. And if you find a riad that provides such a copious and high-quality breakfast at the price you paid, please do let me know. We are in the hospitality business, and at Riad di Siena, we always strive to exceed our guests' expectations, but we also deserve to be treated fairly. When you were at the riad, at any given time, you never asked or said anything. I can understand that it's probably easier to complain after the fact, and I respect that. However, your inability to communicate properly about your needs and expectations does not make us inadequate hosts. I wish you well."

","8","10.0","7.5","10.0","7.5","5.0","7.5","Hello Harald, Thank you for your review. Please note that the riad where you stayed, is the Annex of Riad di Siena; it is easily accessible, located less than 3 m from the main door. When guests stay at the Annex, they also get a key to the main Riad to have breakfast in the courtyard but also enjoy its soothing vibes whenever they wish. The Annex has contemporary decor, but the building is quite old. It is a 300-year-old riad that was part of the Vizir Palace next door. When I renovated it, I decided to use contemporary decor to transform the space with more light and brightness. That said, we only use traditional materials such as beldi cement tiles and handmade textiles and ceramics. Everything in this riad has been handmade by local artisans, not purchased from a generic big box store. The breakfasts all guests enjoy are also home-made, and we only use fresh ingredients that we get from local organic farmers. We make them from scratch, not store-bought. For the price you paid for the room, you would typically get a hostel room without an ensuite bathroom—most probably at half the size of the room you had—and a rudimentary breakfast. I understand that the facilities and amenities were not to your full satisfaction, but everything we listed on Booking is what guests will get at our riad - not less, not more. If guests expect more, they should look for a riad with more amenities and facilities. We do not pretend to be something that we are not. Riad di Siena is a beautiful but simple Riad with an emphasis on the human qualities of our team and the exceptional food we serve. That said, thank you for your suggestions. We always do our best to continually improve our offerings. Best wishes to you."

The room was dark and humid - no windows and sunlight, also no air ventilation in the bathroom = impossible for our towels to dry and since they were never changed on the third day they were already smelling like mould... The electricity stopped twice when we tried to use the AC to get warm and dry out the air... When the electricity stopped we also didnt have WiFi of course which made it impossible to contact anyone for help... Thank god I went outside the room to find and turn on the switch by myself in the middle of the night, otherwise we would have stayed without light and any contact all night. The breakfast was same every morning and since my partner doesn't eat eggs we requested for some alternative; The second day my message wasn't even answered and on the last day when we clearly requested that to two people, guess what - we again received an omelette...

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback about your recent stay with us. While we are always thrilled to receive positive feedback, we appreciate your honest thoughts, even when they highlight areas where we can improve.
We understand your concerns regarding the room and apologize if it did not fully meet your expectations. Please allow us to address your specific points:
Room ventilation: The door includes a window for air circulation. Perhaps you were not aware of this during your stay? We shall ensure it is clearly communicated to future guests.
Electricity: We regularly check the electricity, and, unfortunately, you did not mention this during your stay. We always fix issues as soon as guests tell us.
Towel drying: We apologize if the current towel drying arrangement was not readily apparent.
Room brightness: Feedback on lighting can be subjective. While another guest found the same room too bright, we understand that you found it too dark for your preferences.
Breakfast preferences: We offer daily menu variations and provide customized meals to guests who have allergies and specific dietary preferences. Based on our investigation, we did not find any record of your request to Khadija. All requests must be made to Khadija, not to the kitchen staff.
Room cleaning: Daily cleaning is performed for each room. We apologize if this was not to your satisfaction.
Communication: We strive for prompt responses to guest inquiries. While nighttime hours may limit immediate responses, we appreciate your understanding.
We value open communication and strongly encourage guests to share any concerns during their stay, allowing us to address them in real time. Your feedback helps us improve and continuously enhance the guest experience.
While we understand your disappointment, we believe our extensive positive reviews from other guests reflect our ongoing commitment to excellence. We strive to consistently exceed expectations, and your feedback helps us identify areas for improvement.
Your comments on our rating. I was saddened by your reviews—to be honest, they were very harsh and your comment about our rating is unfair. Every guest has their own experience, and they all have every right to give us a high rating if they feel that we deserve it—and we do. We do not buy fake reviews. All reviews are genuine. So we definitely deserve the 9+ that we have on booking. And you can read all our other reviews on riaddisiena. Being highly rated by more than 500 guests is not just a pure coincidence. In any case, I am sad that you did not enjoy your experience, but I am convinced that if you reached out to me during your stay, I could have made things right on the spot. Thank you for your feedback. Much love and light."

Merci pour vos commentaires.

Je suis vraiment désolée si vous avez été importunée par du bruit. Il est vrai que nous sommes situés dans la Médina, à deux pas de la Place Jemaa el-Fna, un quartier animé et vibrant. Même si cela reste rare, il peut arriver qu'il y ait des activités nocturnes. Cependant, je tiens à vous rassurer, cela n'arrive que très exceptionnellement. Cette semaine, le Festival du livre d'Afrique etait organise a quelque pas du Riad.

En ce qui concerne la salle de bain, elle est nettoyée minutieusement chaque jour. Il est possible que ce que vous ayez perçu comme ""sale"" soit en réalité le résultat des matériaux traditionnels que nous utilisons au Maroc, comme le carrelage beldi et les douches en cuivre faites à la main. En Europe, les salles de bain sont souvent immaculées et stériles, mais ici, au Maroc, le charme réside dans l'authenticité et les imperfections.

J'accorde une grande importance à la satisfaction de mes invités et je suis toujours à l'écoute de leurs commentaires. Vos commentaires nous aident a nous ameliorer et a renforcer le confort et le bonheur de nos invites."

Most of all, thank you for taking the time to provide your comments. All constructive feedback help us improve our guest services. Regarding your less positive comments: 1-we have installed a window in the room and an air conditionner. We will strive to find other solutions as they become available. Please remember that in the Medina, humidity will be a recurrent issue. Staying in the medina in old riads is not for everyone 2-We also understand you might not have read our policy regarding henna stains on towels and bedsheets. As outlined in the pre-arrival email and booking conditions on our website, we kindly request guests to avoid using linens for activities that can cause permanent stains, including henna application. Unfortunately, it is not possible to remove these stains, so this is considered a damaged item. This policy aligns with practices commonly found in riads and hotels worldwide. We certainly do not ask for a cleaning fee, only if the guest damages the towel - this has been communicated clearly in our message to you. To avoid this fee, you should have refrained from using the towel when your henna tatoo has not dried. When you had your tattoo, did you make sure that it did not touch your shirt? If so, why didn't you make sure that it did not touch towels that did not belong to you. In fact, you adamantly refused to pay that fee Please understand that in any hotel, when you damage something, they have the right to charge your credit card even if you refuse to pay the fee. We did not. And we wish you well."

Thank you for taking the time to leave a review! We're delighted you enjoyed your stay at our riad.
We understand your concern about the gap under the door. While it's true that insects can sometimes find their way in through small openings - this is the law of nature - we can assure you that we take pest control very seriously. And until now, insects have never been an issue. Moreover, please understand the historic nature of our riad. Built in the 18th century, the riad boasts many beautiful semi-antique doors. Replacing them with modern versions would unfortunately compromise the unique charm of the property. Riads, by their nature, offer a traditional experience that may differ from a modern hotel. While we strive to provide all the comforts you expect, some guests may prefer the more standardized fixtures and furniture offered by hotels. On our website, we explain our philosophy: the art of wabi sabi. Perfectly imperfect or rather, imperfectly perfect! :) We appreciate your understanding."

Were the sheets clean? Was the riad quiet? No, there were no issues because for sure, you would have complained about them. It is so easy to take the good things for granted and focus on the unimportant ones. If the issue is just that you could not make yourself understood because of language barriers, don't you know that communication is a two-way street? We were available to you but you chose to stay quiet and gave us low ratings instead. I also asked our housekeeper to come at 6.45 a.m. because I know you arrived late and I was aiming to treat you to a warm breakfast. We don't normally do this. Breakfast starts at 8.30 a.m. You arrived after 9 p.m and left the next morning at 7 a.m. But you found it necessary to write of your dissatisfaction and disappointment when you spent less than 12 hours on the property. You paid less than 50 euros for the room but you are showing the disappointment of someone who has paid 500 euros and got themselves bamboozled. If you don't know how to appreciate the imperfections of a traditional guest house, the many benefits that our riad offers, and you have unclear expectations, you should have stayed at a modern hotel that would have better met your needs.

Buona ed abbondante la colazione (yogurt con frutta secca, marmellate, pane di vari tipi, macedonia, succo d'arancia, caffè e omelette) anche se la mia compagna dopo aver mangiato una macedonia di platano e mela, della spremuta d'arancia ed un'omelette ha dato di stomaco.
Preciso che è celiaca, aveva segnalato in anticipo il suo problema e le era stato semplicemente detto di evitare il pane, quindi non abbiamo capito se sia stata male per la celiachia o per il cibo in sé.","La stanza era sporchissima, con dei tappeti ed una coperta di lana polverosi che abbiamo dovuto far rimuovere e sotto cui c'era talmente tanta sporcizia che hanno dovuto spazzare di nuovo per terra. La biancheria da letto presentava delle macchie ed era tutta ingiallita gliel'abbiamo fatta cambiare e, nel mentre, è uscito da sotto il materasso uno scarafaggio gigante. Loro, inizialmente infastidite dalla richiesta, non si sono minimamente preoccupate e ci hanno detto che stavano disinfestando (quindi erano consapevoli del problema e si sono ben guardate dal segnalarlo).
La stanza era molto umida e lo confermano le varie foto della muffa sulle pareti e del legno e per mascherare l'odore hanno messo candele e vaporizzatore. Inoltre, era buia e non c'erano finestre (fatto furbescamente taciuto dalle foto) e la porta non chiudeva bene, non c'era la serratura, ma era un portone a due ante con lucchetto che lasciava un'intercapedine di 3-4 cm dal pavimento da cui poteva entrare qualsiasi animale, essendo piano strada e non riparava minimamente dai rumori. Dopo le ""pulizie"" iniziali non sono più passate a pulire la stanza e hanno cambiato una sola volta gli asciugamani.
Totalmente sprovvista di armadi/cassettiere, c'era unicamente un appendiabiti a muro dotato di 5 grucce. 
Porta del bagno e muri sporchi.
Assente la tenda della doccia.","2","2.5","2.5","7.5","2.5","2.5","2.5","The previous guests who stayed in the same room gave us a perfect 10. Yet here you are, filled with so much venom. Veni. Vidi. Exivi. Why didn't you run as you said? When you arrived on the first day and were unhappy with the room, we offered you the opportunity to cancel without any penalty fee. You declined and insisted on staying. For the sake of both parties, it would have been better if you had not stayed. If you didn't like the room at first sight, chances are you would continue to find faults. What a waste of energy! But unfortunately, you stayed, and now I have to address your long list of complaints.
First, you didn't take the time to read all the communications I sent you before your arrival, especially the part about informing us in advance of any allergies. You were also in contact with our riad manager before your arrival. Did you think of letting her know of your specific needs? You only mentioned your allergies when you came for breakfast. Did you think we have easy access to gluten-free bread like in Europe or a large kitchen staff to whip up gluten-free pastries on short notice? Despite this, we still bought gluten-free bread for you for the following days, which, of course, you failed to mention. You are not children; you should know what you can eat, especially if you have allergies. Why suggest that we deliberately caused your food poisoning because we “refused” to give you gluten-free bread?
Second, your claims about dust and cleaning are completely false, hurtful, and defamatory. The room and textiles were not dirty. You should educate yourself about the configuration of a riad as well as the imperfections of vintage handmade rugs, textiles, and all Moroccan handicrafts. Do you know what a vintage Moroccan rug looks like? Yes, to uneducated people, they might look dirty, but they are not. Handmade cement tiles in Morocco can appear imperfect and, unfortunately, absorb stains. We cleaned the room every day during your stay. Even if we cleaned your room every half hour, you would have found something to complain about. If the room was truly that dirty, don't you think other guests would have flagged it? Imagine this: for the past year, many ""clueless"" guests have stayed in our ""dirty"" room and slept on a ""filthy"" bed without knowing it! You are the first person who saw these horrible things and saved us all!! It's unfortunate that you didn't like your room, but that doesn't give you the right to accuse us of dishonesty and bad intentions, or to exaggerate and invent problems that didn't exist.
Every flaw you mentioned, like humidity or rooms with no windows, are common in all riads in the Medina. There are even other issues that you did not have to experience with us: very small rooms with limited space, smelly drains, no water pressure, no hot water, non-functioning AC, no wifi signals, a 20-minute walk from the main square, constant noise, no privacy, sweet breakfast options, rude staff, bad neighborhood, etc. I'm glad you didn't mention these because you did not experience them at our riad, but you might in other riads.
To help our guests understand local life in the Medina and how we operate, we are meticulously honest in our communications; we don’t withhold anything. Our riad has a 100% occupancy rate, and we don't force anyone to choose us. Claiming that we hide information on purpose is simply disingenuous. Work on your negative point of view when you visit a country with a different culture. You seem to expect the worst in people and situations. Did any animals come into your room during your stay? Do you think an insect or a mouse needs a door to enter a room? The doors of the room are antiques, almost 100 years old. Removing them would be a shame. What's the point of focusing on all the what-ifs? When people focus on the negative, that's what they will see. So, if you have decided that we are the worst, that's your prerogative, and it only reflects on you. And remember. We gave you the opportunity to run. You could have switched hotel on the first day. On the second day. On the third day. But you decided to stay in the “filth”. I personally would not if a room is that dirty. As a first time visitor of Marrakech, reading my messages would have helped you understand the challenges of staying in the Medina. Or chose another accommodation. Next time, considering your high expectations and mindset, book a modern hotel with luxurious amenities outside of the Medina."

Our rooms are unusually spacious, especially compared to most riads that have smaller rooms. Regarding noise, 99% of the time, the riad is quiet. Any noise does not come from our staff. However, absolute silence cannot be guaranteed if there are other guests in the house. Moreover, houses in the Medina are built close to each other.

The last night we have to move to room 3, the owner, Ms. Khadija informed us about that only on the day we arrived. 
Room 3 is not good at all, luckily, we stayed there only for 1 night. The air conditioner did not work, it was very hot. It was Sunday, I contacted Ms.Khadija about that and asked her if we could have a fan for that night but got no reply. We had to sleep on the floor and opened all the window. The window to the street has no glass window so that it was noisy when there were people around. The toilet has no window, no air circulation to the outside, and there is always bad smell from sewage pipe. I hope Ms.Khadija will try to repair it soon for the other guests","8","7.5","7.5","10.0","7.5","7.5","7.5","Hello Thuy
Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback. I am sorry that your last night was uncomfortable but please understand that when it is 48oC in Marrakech it's really hard to keep up the air conditioner during the hot days. To accommodate your special request,  I gave you a superior room, at a much higher price point but unfortunately the last day that room was already booked. Khadija did not respond to you because she was sleeping. As I mentioned in my communications, any requests made during the night are addressed in the morning by which time you have already left. This is Marrakech, riads typically don't have glass windows and as I told you in all transparency, the riad is quiet most of the time but I cannot control noise outside of the riad when people are living their lives in an urban setting. Expecting utter silence in a place where houses are close to each other is impossible. I systematically find solutions for any issues that I find or flagged by my guests but there are several things that are out of my control and are experienced by most houses in the Medina. Staying in the old Medina comes with its ad-hoc challenges and demands an openness to imperfections and unfamiliar situations. I have communicated this in my messages to you before you arrive. I am always available to answer tuests' questions and concerns during working hours. Kind regards."

Rooms  at the main riad start at 105 euros per night. The rooms in the annex average 50 euros per night. We give guests the room they reserved. You did not reserve a room in the main riad. We are not a hotel where rooms are assigned randomly.  As clearly stated in our house rules, our rooms are fully cleaned every 3 days and refreshed daily. If guests wish for a full clean every day, they can request it. If you found so many faults in that room you would also find faults in the rooms in the main riad. We believe in the wabi sabi philosophy which exalts perfect imperfection. It's unfortunate but it is clear that no matter what we do for our guests, we cannot satisfy everyone. To future guests, before booking with us, please make sure to read our disclaimer on our website. Welcome to Morocco where embracing its people's amazing hospitality as well as the imperfect beauty of its landscapes and human structures are much more important than nitpicking and griping. Staying in a riad in the old medina is imperfect. But that's what makes it beautiful and unforgettable. I am sorry for you that you could not appreciate that."

Firstly, thank you for your review. I am happy that you enjoyed your stay with us.

I am sincerely sorry that you felt unsafe on the streets of Marrakech. I am relieved to know that you are okay. 

However, I must respectfully disagree with your assessment of the safety of our neighborhood. 

It's important to understand that the Medina, by its very nature, can appear ""sketchy"" to first-time visitors. Many riads are located deeper within the labyrinthine alleyways. However, our riad enjoys a prime location, just steps away from Mohamed V Boulevard and the vibrant Jemaa el Fna square. We believe we offer one of the most convenient and well-situated accommodations in the Medina. Furthermore, a police station is located nearby, and plainclothes officers are consistently patrolling the area. 

As a reminder to future guests, I provide detailed step-by-step instructions with accompanying images to guide them to the riad. I urge all guests to carefully review these instructions before their arrival. And if you do not wish to venture out on your own, I will be happy to help

Much love and happiness to you."

Thank you for your review. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay with us and appreciated the friendly staff, cleanliness, delicious breakfast, and central location.

I understand that the alleyways in the Medina can feel a bit overwhelming at first, especially at night. We do provide detailed directions with pictures and a video to help our guests find the riad easily. You can find them here: [link to directions].  If you'd prefer not to walk alone, we're also happy to arrange for someone to meet you at a central location and guide you to the riad. Just let us know in advance.  I'm glad we were able to assist you in finding the riad when you called us.

We are located in the ultra-safe neighborhood of Laksour, just a 2-minute walk from Place Jemaa el-Fna, so you can enjoy the peace and quiet while still being close to all the action.

I hope you'll visit us again and have a chance to become more familiar with the charming labyrinthine alleyways of the Medina!"

Plutôt qu’une réponse directe, nous avons reçu plusieurs explications évasives et contradictoires. La conversation a ensuite dégénéré en accusations infondées. Tout au long de cet échange, je suis restée professionnelle et respectueuse.

Le client a choisi de partir et, bien que je n’y sois aucunement obligée, j'ai décidé d’accorder un remboursement total – non pas comme un aveu de faute, mais comme un geste de bonne volonté afin de clore l’incident et préserver la sérénité de tous.

La gentillesse fait partie intégrante de nos valeurs. Mais la gentillesse ne signifie pas faiblesse. Faire respecter des règles claires et raisonnables ne signifie pas avoir un mauvais comportement, pas plus que rester ferme face à des déclarations contradictoires. Le respect et l’équité fonctionnent dans les deux sens. Nous faisons preuve de courtoisie et de compréhension envers tous nos clients, mais attendons la même chose en retour.

Room: The room is not something luxury (as already mentioned in the decsription) but it was nice and cozy.
Breakfast: Good and handmade. Each day, something different was prepared by the lady in the kitchen.
Property's location: a little hard to be found at first, due to the structure of the roads, but after the first time it was easy. Directly in the center of the city, with lot's of good options for food and drink.","Room: the room was located on the ground floor. During our stay, there was a heavy downpour, which caused the riad's courtyard to flood and the water to enter the room. We were out of the room at the time. The staff's actions were immediate (they opened the large manhole to drain the water, and cleaned the room again).
From the smell of humidity that was already present in the room, I understand that this was not the first time something like this had happened.","7","10.0","10.0","10.0","7.5","10.0","7.5","Thank you for your feedback. We’re glad you acknowledged Zahra’s care. That said, we’d like to address several points raised in your review.

You expressed disappointment that the room was “not something luxury.” To be clear—we never described it as such. Nowhere in our listing, on our website, or in our guest communication do we use the word luxury. We are deliberate with language. We describe The Riad as a sanctuary. We speak of care, simplicity done well, and a lived-in presence. But never luxury.

And yet, that is the paradox:
We are being benchmarked against a standard we never claimed.
We clearly communicated that this space is rooted in simplicity and authenticity.
Still, we are judged for not offering what we never promised to begin with.

It’s important not to confuse sacred care with hotel luxury. They are not the same. What we offer is not curated through branding or polish—it is lived, handmade, and intentional. We do not offer high-gloss surfaces or boutique theatrics. We offer presence, rhythm, and quiet detail.

To guests unfamiliar with this kind of offering, care may be misread as luxury. But that is a misunderstanding of tone, not a failure of service.

We are not here to impress.
We are here to hold space.
For those seeking something real, that is more than enough.

And real is not shiny. Not polished. Not perfection. And not luxury.

—

You received clear, step-by-step arrival instructions, including live WhatsApp support. We remained in contact throughout your stay. All you had to do was ask.

Regarding our location: The Riad is less than two minutes on foot from Place Jemaa el Fna. We are not hidden in the deep maze of the medina. We are central, accessible, and safe.

As for the humidity: this is common in traditional riads, particularly in the warmer months. These homes are built around enclosed courtyards that regulate temperature, but naturally limit airflow. This is not unique to our house—it is part of medina architecture. We communicated this clearly before arrival.

We have taken steps to mitigate it, including installing windows in doors and providing air conditioning in all rooms. But this is still a traditional home—not a sealed, climate-controlled hotel.

The flash flood on Saturday was a rare and extreme weather event. Zahra responded immediately and resolved the situation with care and speed.

We wish you clarity and ease in your future travels."

We’re glad you appreciated the location and our care, though the harsh score does not reflect the kindness and generosity you received. It seems the room did not meet your preconceived expectations, and that outweighed the human care offered.

Our house is not for everyone—and that’s okay. We hope to host guests who look beyond the expectation for “luxury” and “perfection” and begin to appreciate her for what she truly is. And we are grateful for the many guests who do.

To future guests: please read our pre-arrival messages. We never pretend to be what we are not.

You rated us 10 across every category — cleanliness, comfort, staff, and facilities — thank you for this. Yet you gave a 7 overall, based solely on noise caused by other guests. That is, of course, your prerogative, and we respect that.

Still, we must speak plainly: this is not a fair reflection of our work. Your dissatisfaction had nothing to do with our service, attention, or care. And the issue with noise from other guests was never raised during your stay — we cannot resolve what is not communicated.

We offer real hospitality here — not performance. We plan, communicate, and care with consistency and depth. Most guests recognize this. Some, however, take it for granted.

At the end of the day, a rating is just a number. We will continue to run this house with integrity, heart, and clarity — not because we seek approval, but because that is our standard.

Kindness is not weakness. And when there is unfairness, we respond with truth — calmly, 
 clearly, precisely.

We wish you well."

Noi abbiamo alloggiato al riad secondario, a pochi metri da quello principale, dove si consuma la colazione. La camera è molto ampia, , letto matrimoniale grande e abbastanza comodo, lenzuola pulite. Non ci sono armadi, ma solo un appendiabiti con qualche gruccia e delle mensole con soprammobili che ho provveduto a spostare per creare spazio per riporre gli indumenti. Il bagno non è piccolo, ma il lavandino è minuscolo. Essendo un riad, la camera non ha finestre verso l' esterno , ma delle finestrelle sulla porta che danno verso il cortile centrale  Wifi eccellente e aria condizionata efficiente. La colazione è molto buona, tutto fatto dalle due donne che gestiscono il riad e cambia ogni giorno. Inizia alle 8 .30, ma puoi chiedere l' anticipo alle 8. Per partenza prima delle 8 ti forniscono una box con 3 brioches diverse e l' acqua. La comunicazione prima e durante il soggiorno é rapida, anche tramite wa. Si possono lasciare i bagagli dopo il check out.","La pulizia all' arrivo era discreta, quotidianamente rifanno il letto (in realtà sollevano solo il piumone senza neppure spostare il telecomando che hai dimenticato sul letto), ma non puliscono il bagno. Avrebbero dovuto fare una pulizia  completa dopo la terza notte, invece hanno cambiato solo gli asciugamani, bagno mai pulito. Toglierei i tappeti che circondano il letto che essendo molto grandi non possono essere lavati a ogni cambio clienti e quindi non sono puliti.","8","7.5","5.0","10.0","7.5","5.0","7.5","Thank you for taking the time to share your impressions.

I hear your concerns, and I understand that cleanliness is a core priority for you. We are a small, lived-in riad—not a hotel—and while we strive for warmth, care, and attentiveness, we do not offer standardized daily housekeeping. Our cleaning protocols are intentionally simple and transparent, as stated in the listing and reinforced during our communication prior to your stay.

When you requested bathroom photos before booking, I gently suggested that if perfection in that area was essential, you might be happier elsewhere. That advice still stands. We do not pretend to be what we are not. We offer a soulful, real environment—one that values beauty, authenticity, and human presence over sterile polish.

Your feedback about the rugs is noted. However, these are traditional Moroccan rugs—woven by hand, large, and heavy. They require professional cleaning and take several days to dry. It is not realistic, nor common practice in Morocco, to wash them between each guest. Hotels, by contrast, typically use wall-to-wall synthetic carpeting or washable textiles for precisely this reason. A traditional riad with vintage pieces carries a different rhythm—and different responsibilities.

Not every space is for everyone. And that’s okay. I wish you well on your continued travels—and hope you find the kind of perfection that brings you peace."

When you decided to give us a 2.0 for location and called it “very hidden,” it likely means you didn’t read the step-by-step arrival directions (with photos) we send in advance — and you may not fully understand how the medina is structured.

All riads in Marrakech are “hidden.” That’s the nature of life in the medina.
Did you see any riads lining the main streets or in the middle of the souks?
Did you have to walk 20 minutes to the main square? That’s the standard.

Ours is one of the most accessible riads in the city.

To future guests: please read the pre-arrival messages.
They contain everything you need to find us easily and know what to expect.
We also offer live WhatsApp support — if you get lost or need anything, just ask.
Giving us a low rating because you chose not to read or ask for help is frustrating — and unfair.

We are present, responsive, and clear.

Low ratings for location or comfort usually come from guests who arrive unprepared and expect a version of luxury that has nothing to do with what we actually offer. Our pre-arrival messages explain it all — what we provide, and what we don’t.

People who seek a feeling of home and heart-based service love us.
People who seek performative luxury often don’t — and tend to leave mediocre reviews for “problems” that aren’t actually problems.

Know the difference.

If you gave us a 4.0 because the room was dirty, there was no hot water, or the staff was rude — that would be fair. But those things didn’t happen.

We can’t — and won’t — cater to imagined expectations.
Read the listing. Read the pre-arrival messages.
Rate us on what we actually offer — not what you assumed we might.

And if something is missing, tell us. That’s how reviews help us grow.

Reviews are meant to reward what a business does well — not punish it for what it never claimed to offer. We go above and beyond — and guests who read, ask, and engage always recognize this.

But when reviews reflect misaligned expectations rather than actual experience, they say more about the reviewer than the house.

If you asked for something and we failed to deliver, a 4.0 is fair.
But if you said in person that everything was wonderful — and later gave us a low score from behind a screen — that’s not feedback. That’s avoidance.

Reviews are not a game. They carry real consequences.
When used to punish rather than reflect, that’s a misuse of power."

I am glad you appreciated our hospitality, the kindness of our staff and the generous breakfast we provide. 

You booked your stay in the middle of summer at a heavily discounted rate. Compared to our regular pricing from September to July, you received exceptional value. Even at this reduced rate, we provided the same outstanding breakfast and services. Many establishments scale back when discounting, but we chose not to.

The room you stayed in was the one reserved, as confirmed in two pre-arrival messages. We do not assign rooms randomly. At check-in, you said you were not happy with the room, and we gave you the option to cancel. You chose to continue your stay.

The door you mention is an antique of more than 100 years. Bolts and padlocks are standard in Marrakech riads, part of the city’s architectural heritage. Preserving these details is deliberate—our riad is an 18th-century home, not a modern hotel. All ancient riads in Marrakech have that door. If you expected a modern Western locking system, you can find them at standard hotels.

If by “it could be better” you mean new fittings and a modern, sanitized and flawless hotel style, that is not who we are, and this is made clear in our pre-arrival messages and on our website. For the benefit of future guests, we always appreciate precise feedback rather than vague comments. Our house offers handmade furnishings, authentic character, and attentive service at a value far beyond the rate paid. It is unfortunate that you could not appreciate this. We wish you well."

We sent you two pre-arrival messages with step-by-step directions to the riad, in both English and Spanish. Many guests have told us these instructions are foolproof. The only reason someone gets lost is if they choose not to read them.

Our riad is centrally located — just a 2-minute walk from the main boulevard and Jemaa el Fna square. It is neither hidden nor far from the main landmarks. You gave us a 5 for location, which suggests you may not have realised just how prime our position is. Few riads offer this level of centrality and convenience while still remaining peaceful.

As for breakfast: the bread is made fresh in-house, along with everything else we serve. We offer a full spread including homemade jams, fresh fruit, yogurt, and our signature shakshuka. I was surprised to read that you found it insufficient. We are one of the very few riads that prepares everything from scratch — nothing is store-bought. It's unfortunate these small details — which many of our guests value — didn’t resonate with you."

Throughout your stay, Zahra checked in to make sure everything was going well, and you consistently responded that all was fine.

Thank you for your kind words about our service, location, and breakfast — we appreciate that you rated them highly.

As for the shower: we do not provide broken amenities. You described our service as formidable, which makes it difficult to imagine we would neglect or “sabotage” a guest experience in any way. No issue was reported during your stay, and when Zahra checked with you, you confirmed everything was fine. Guests before and after you had no difficulty, which points to a misunderstanding in how the shower operates.

I’ll repeat for the 100th time: if something isn’t working as expected, inform Zahra or Mouad immediately so it can be fixed on the spot. Reporting it after departure helps no one — not you, not us, and not future guests.

We always encourage open communication during the stay. It’s disappointing when guests choose to vent in reviews instead of giving us the opportunity to assist in real time."

Thank you for sharing your perspective.

Recollections may vary, so for clarity, here is what applies to your stay:

• Staff availability—You confirmed you would return for your luggage before 5:00 PM, during staff hours. When you arrived much later and without notice, the door was locked for guest safety. As soon as we received your message, we arranged for the night guardian to let you in.

• Access and codes—Zahra showed you how to access the key box and provided the door key after check-out. Once a guest has the key, the box code is no longer required.

• Breakfast—We serve a traditional Moroccan breakfast (fresh fruit, bread, olive oil, jams, etc.). Vegan or gluten-free options are always possible—we simply need to know in advance so we can prepare them. No dietary request was communicated.
• Communication—Check-in instructions, all operational details, and our WhatsApp contacts were shared before arrival.
• Environment—The Medina is a UNESCO-protected historic area. Its alleys can feel unfamiliar on a first visit, yet once inside, guests consistently describe the riad as peaceful and calming.

Clarity and boundaries are not rudeness.

We remain courteous in all communication—even when the tone we receive is not.

Zahra is consistently praised for her attentiveness and kindness. It is unfortunate that you felt otherwise.

If your experience of the city felt overwhelming or intense, we genuinely hope your next travels bring more ease and calm."

Merci d’avoir partagé votre ressenti avec méthode.

Nous prenons note de vos remarques.

La fermeté du matelas relève de la perception individuelle — et, au Maroc, la literie est naturellement un peu plus ferme qu’en Europe.

Pour les cafards : comme indiqué dans nos messages avant votre arrivée, il peut arriver d’en voir lorsque le sol est chaud. C’est courant dans la médina, même dans les établissements les mieux notés.

Pour l’odeur : le réseau d’égout du centre historique est ancien, et son intensité varie selon les jours. La climatisation contribue généralement à atténuer ce phénomène.

Je vous souhaite de belles expériences pour la suite de votre voyage au Maroc."

La ragazza che gestisce la struttura è molto gentile ed ha arredato in maniera eccellente la stanza rendendola molto confortevole ed accogliente. Colazione con prodotti fatti da lei, buonissimi.","Meglio arrivarci di giorno e con Internet ben funzionante perché dovrete seguire delle istruzioni che riceverete su whatsapp o nella chat di Booking perché non bisognerà seguire Google maps per raggiungere la struttura.","8","10.0","10.0","10.0","10.0","10.0","10.0",""
